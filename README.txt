# NS2 GunGame

.. is the modification that makes you to act with various guns and not only with your favourite one.
You start with the first pistol and after number of designated kills you "level up" to the next weapon
and so on and so forth through all the weapons, ending with the grenade and axe. The first person
to reach max level wins overall. You still have teams, therefore its not just FFA like you might think.
